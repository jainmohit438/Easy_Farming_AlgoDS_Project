We need to modernise our agricultural sector.We need to connect them with technology and provide them a plateform where they can sell or buy product.And we need to bring our farmers to banking.So, we have tried to implement it and provide  them a plateform.

INTRODUCTION

We are making a program which will be very useful for farmers.We want to link our farmers to new techonological world which will help them in many ways.
We will basically have 5 classes the details and use are given below:

1.Farmer:- Containing his id,personnel details,crop details and his farm details.

CONCLUSION

While making of the project on “EASY FARMING” we made progress by solving a number of the problems. Solution to each problem by ourselves was the most important part of the project and this provided us with experience which will help us in future we came to know that how we can use Data Structure like LIST OF LIST AND CONNECTING MYSQL IN C++ TO STORE DATA in different ways. Some important things that we learned include designing a good program architecture and converting real life situations into an efficient code and how to write an good looking easily readable and understandable as well as time and memory efficient code.
